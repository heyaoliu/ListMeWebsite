  ### ListMe Trademark Policy

  This Policy covers general rules for referring to ListMe and using its
  trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, “ListMe Marks”).

  The following is a non-exhaustive list of ListMe Marks:

  **1.  ListMe Logo**

  **2.  ListMe Name**

  **3.  ListMe Full Logo**

  ListMe reserves the right to change the terms of this Policy or any guidelines
  at any time, in its sole discretion, by posting the updated Policy or guidelines
  to the ListMe website. To ask any questions about this Policy or to report any
  unauthorized use of ListMe Marks, please email
  [support@listmeapp.co](mailto:support@listmeapp.co)

  #### General Rule: Permission Required

  As a rule, a trademark license is required in order to use ListMe Marks. Except
  for exceptions outlined below, this Policy does not count as “permission to use”
  any trademarks. To request permission to use any ListMe marks, please email
  support@listmeapp.co.

  #### Exceptions

  The relevant Terms and Conditions specify that:

  -   If you use the ListMe App as an Event Organiser, you may use ListMe Marks
  for the purpose of referring to or describing ListMe’s website, app,
  products, and services or the Event Organiser’s use of the App. For example,
  you may use the ListMe Marks to promote your events.

  -   However, you agree not to sell, sublicense, rent, modify, distribute,
  copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish,
  adapt, edit, attempt to derive the source code of, or create derivative
  works of, any ListMe Marks.

  -   If you use the ListMe App as a Guest:

  -   You agree to only use the ListMe Marks in connection with your use of
  the intended functionality of app or website (unless otherwise expressly
  authorised by ListMe in writing); and

  -   You agree not to sell, sublicense, rent, modify, distribute, copy,
  reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt,
  edit, attempt to derive the source code of, or create derivative works
  of any ListMe Marks, or post any ListMe Marks on any other web site or
  in a networked computer environment for any purpose.

  #### Specifications for Use

  All uses of ListMe Marks must comply with the applicable trademark guidelines
  and also:

  -   **Identify the ListMe marks as registered trademarks.**
  The above-listed ListMe Marks are registered by ListMe in the U.K. For the
  first and most prominent usage of the above-listed ListMe Marks in any
  context, use ® as a notice to third parties of ListMe’s rights in these
  ListMe Marks. (Later uses on that same website, document, or other material
  do not need to be marked.)

  -   **Include a trademark attribution statement.**
  If any ListMe Mark appears on your website, promotional materials, document,
  or any other material, add the following attribution statement that
  identifies ListMe as the trademark owner:

  “ListMe is a registered trademark. All Rights Reserved.”

  The statement must be in a legible font and size at the bottom of your
  website or the end of your advertisement or publication. If you are using
  only one or two ListMe Marks, you may shorten the statement to list only
  those Marks in use. Additionally, any use of the ListMe logo on a website
  must include a live link to the ListMe website.

  -   **Use ListMe Marks only as adjectives.**
  Trademarks are adjectives, and any ListMe Mark should be used only to
  describe the ListMe website, app, products, or services to which the
  trademark applies.

  -   **Use ListMe Marks less prominently than your own.**
  Except where otherwise expressly permitted by ListMe, any use of an ListMe
  Mark must appear *less prominent* than your own product or service name.

  -   **Do NOT change the spelling or appearance of any ListMe Marks.**
  Do not abbreviate, hyphenate, create acronyms; change the spelling,
  capitalization, or appearance; add or delete any words or spacing; change
  any color or proportion; or otherwise modify the logo or design of any
  ListMe Mark in any way. Only use an approved logo rendition as provided by
  ListMe.

  -   **Do NOT use or register a domain name with any ListMe Marks.**
  Your domain names may not include any ListMe Marks or other words that are
  confusingly similar to any ListMe Mark.

  -   **Do NOT use any ListMe Marks as your own.**
  You may not use, incorporate, combine, or register in whole or in part any
  ListMe Mark - or any word or design that is confusingly similar to an ListMe
  Mark - as part of (or with) your own company names, trade names, trademarks,
  service marks, or logos; your product or service brand names or titles for
  sales reps or other staff; your internet keywords or metatags; or your
  trigger words to lead to a website or other Internet destination, product,
  business, or service.

  -   **Do NOT imply any ListMe endorsement or sponsorship.**
  Without the express prior written consent of ListMe, you may not use any
  ListMe Marks to imply any approval, sponsorship, or endorsement by ListMe of
  your company, website, products, or services.

  -   **Do NOT use ListMe Marks in any way that damages ListMe.**
  You may not use ListMe Marks in a manner that disparages ListMe, its
  products or services, or the ListMe community or damages ListMe’s brand
  integrity, including use of any ListMe’s Marks in a manner that is
  offensive, defamatory, illegal, or unethical.

  The above specifications are not a comprehensive list of approved or
  unauthorized uses of ListMe Marks. If ListMe determines at any time, in its sole
  discretion, that your use of any ListMe Mark violates this Policy or is
  otherwise unacceptable or detrimental, ListMe may revoke permission, and you
  must immediately cease all use of the ListMe Mark.
