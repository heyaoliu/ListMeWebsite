  #### 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES

  ##### **2.1 The Services**

  >   Through the GuestApp or on the ListMe website, you may purchase admission to
  >   Events arranged and organized by our partners (each an "Event Organiser"),
  >   upon which your name will be presented on the guestlist for the relevant
  >   Event without the issuance of a physical ticket. You may use the GuestApp to

  >   respect of Event Organiser Events and cannot be held responsible or liable
  >   in any way for such Events towards you, the Event Organiser or any other
  >   third party. It is solely your responsibility to determine if an Event
  >   and/or Event Organiser will meet your needs and expectations. If you have
  >   any questions or complaints regarding an Event, you should contact the
  >   relevant Event Organiser directly. ListMe will not participate in disputes
  >   between you and an Event Organiser.

  #### 4. PURCHASING ADMISSION TO EVENTS AND TABLE SERVICES

  ##### **4.1 Making a purchase**

  When you have created an account, you are able to purchase admission to Events
  and to reserve, submit name on guestlists and/or prepay for Table Services.
  First, choose the Services you wish to use. Then, review the total price and in
  the GuestApp make the confirmation by clicking on "ListMe”. The user will only
  be charged if the Event Organiser accepts the user into the venue. If the user
  selects pre-ticket option, then funds are taken right away. Event Organisers can
  offer admission to Events by bidding, in addition to ordinary purchased
  admission. An Event being offered by bidding will not affect admission already
  purchased to such Event. The Event Organiser is not obliged to accept any bid.
  You can place a bid at any Event which is open for bidding by the Event
  Organisers. In connection with placing a bid you will be asked to set a time
  frame for the duration of the bid. If the bid is accepted by the Event Organiser
  within the time frame, a binding non-refundable agreement has been entered into
  between you and the Event Organiser, unless otherwise expressly stated in these
  T&Cs. If the bid is rejected or not accepted within the time frame, your placed
  bid will expire and will no longer be a binding bid. You will only be charged if
  your bid is accepted by the Event Organiser. You can withdraw a placed bid at
  any time, as long as the Event Organiser has not accepted the bid or the time
  frame for the bid has expired. The payments will be administered by our
  third-party payment service provider Stripe. Please note that Stripe may have
  its own terms and conditions which you should read before making a purchase.
  ListMe is not in any way affiliated with Stripe and will not bear any
  responsibility for their T&Cs. When the purchase is completed, you will receive
  a confirmation regarding your purchase through the email address which you have
  provided. Following a successful purchase, your name will be added to the
  guestlist to the relevant Event, and, if applicable, the Event Organiser will be
  notified that you have reserved and paid for a Table Service. Provided that you
  meet any additional terms and conditions which the Event Organiser may have, you
  will be allowed to attend the Event.

  ##### **4.2 Restrictions in respect of purchases**

  You must be of legal age in the jurisdiction in which the Event will take place
  in order to purchase admission to Events. To reserve and prepay for Table
  Services, you must be of legal drinking age in the jurisdiction in which the
  Event will take place. In addition, Event Organisers may have additional terms
  and conditions, such as to the number of people that you are allowed to purchase
  to attend a certain Event, dress code or age limits. You are solely responsible
  for ensuring that you meet the legal age restrictions applicable to the Event
  and that you comply with any additional terms and conditions that the Event
  Organiser may have for a specific Event. By completing the purchase, you warrant
  that you meet all applicable terms and conditions. Your admission to an Event
  may be rejected if you provide false, inaccurate or incomplete information or if
  you are otherwise in breach of, or attempt to circumvent, these T&Cs, or such
  other terms and conditions which the respective Event Organiser may have
  regarding an Event. Your admission may also be rejected if you are intoxicated
  by alcohol or other substances. If your admission has been rejected, your
  license to enter will thereafter be non-useable. ListMe carries no
  responsibility regarding refunds, and should you want a refund after your
  admission has been rejected, you agree to reach out to the Event Organiser.

  ##### **4.3 Service Fee**

  In addition to the purchase price, a non-refundable advance service fee might be
  charged by ListMe to you when using the Services (the "Service Fee"). The total
  amount payable by you (i.e., the purchase price and the Service Fee) will be
  clearly displayed prior to your confirmation of the purchase (applicable at
  times).

  #### 5. NON-REFUNDABLE PURCHASES

  Except as required by applicable law, you are not entitled to cancel purchases
  of admission to Events or reservations/prepayment of Table Services, and all
  such purchases are non-refundable.

  #### 6. CANCELLED EVENTS

  ##### **6.1 General**

  As set out in Clause 2.2 above, We only act as a technical intermediary between
  you and Event Organisers. Each Event Organiser is fully responsible for its
  respective Events and all questions and/or claims in respect of Events should be
  directed to the relevant Event Organiser. If an Event is cancelled, you should
  contact the Event Organiser directly regarding any claims in respect of refunds.
  Please note that the Service Fee is not refundable. We will in no event be
  liable for any damages whatsoever due to cancelled Events.

  ##### **6.2 If Event Organiser is established in a country where Stripe has no presence**

  If the Event Organiser (at the time of the relevant transaction) is established
  in a country where Stripe has no presence, We will hold your payment on a
  separate client account until forty-eight (48) hours after the Event has taken
  place, after which the amount will be transferred to the relevant Event
  Organiser. Should an Event be cancelled, you may be entitled to request a refund
  from Us. To exercise this right, you must notify Us that an Event to which you
  have purchased admission and/or Table Service has been cancelled. You must
  notify Us no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the time when the Event was
  scheduled to begin. Please send an email to
  [support@listmeapp.co](mailto:support@listmeapp.co) with proof that the Event
  has been cancelled and that you would like a refund and state your order ID
  given to you when making the purchase. We will confirm receipt of your request
  for a refund as soon as reasonably possible. Provided that your request reaches
  Us within the above stated time, and that there are no circumstances excluding
  you from a right to a refund, We will, on behalf of the Event Organiser, refund
  the purchase price to the method of payment with which you purchased admission.
  IF YOU FAIL TO CONTACT US WITHIN THE ABOVE STATED TIME, YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED
  TO A REFUND FROM US, AND YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE RELEVANT EVENT ORGANISER
  DIRECTLY WITH POTENTIAL CLAIMS. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SERVICE FEE IS NOT
  REFUNDABLE. For the avoidance of doubt, your right to a refund from Us applies
  only if the Event Organiser is established in a country where Stripe has no
  presence in respect of cancelled Events and only in respect of requests for
  refunds which have been brought to our attention within the above stated time.
  All other claims regarding Events, such as their quality and content etc.,
  should be directed directly towards the relevant Event Organiser. We will in no
  event be liable for any damages whatsoever due to cancelled Events. Information
  about in which countries Stripe is present can be found on
  [www.stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com/).
